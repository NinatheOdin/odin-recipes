        <h4>Caramel Sauce</h4>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g caster sugar</li>
            <li>142ml pot double cream</li>
            <li>50g butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tip the sugar into a heavy-based frying pan, stir in 4 tbsp water, then place over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Turn up the heat and bubble for 4-5 minutes until you have caramel.</li>
            <li>Take off the heat, then carefully stir in the cream and butter.</li>
            <li>Leave the sauce to cool, then tip into a squeezy bottle.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Caramel is made by heating sugar, most often with water in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves and a chemical reaction takes place. This happens at around 160-180C making caramel quite dangerous to work with. At this point the sugar will have already dissolved if using water and starts to brown and take on different flavour notes. A good caramel should be taken to a deep amber colour and taken off and stopped cooking any further at the point where it is on the edge of burning.</p>
